Like Groovy and Scala before it, Kotlin is a new programming language for development 
on the JVM. After reading that Kotlin was being developed by Jetbrains, the folks behind 
the incredible Java IDE IntelliJ, I decided to give it a try a few weeks ago. Here are some 
of my initial impressions of the language.

Kotlin claims to be very simple for Java programmers to learn, and I agree as I was 
able to pick up the langauge easily and quickly convert some existing Java and Groovy 
code to Kotlin.

One piece of code I had was originally written in JavaScript which I then converted to 
Groovy and then to Kotlin. In both JavaScript and Groovy this `piecewise` variable was 
dynamically typed, however with Kotlin being strongly type I obviously have to type it. 

```kotlin
    var piecewise: ((List<Double>,
                     List<Double>,
                     (Double, Double) -> (Double) -> Double,
                     (Double, Double) -> (Double) -> Double) -> (Double) -> Double)? = null
```

Wow! I'm not sure readabiity has been enhanced at all but typing this 
(though type safety certainly has been). Kotlin 1.1 is coming soon and with it the 
introduction of `typealias` which will allow a type to be mapped to an alias, which 
could help in this situation.

### The Good

...

### The Bad

#### Method parameters are val/final

In Kotlin, method parameters are implicitly `val` (`final` in Java-speak). I know that 
some people consider changing the value of a method parameter to be poor practice - and 
I'll admit that I do not do it often - but at times it can be very convinent. I wouldn't
mind if method parameters were `val` by default but could overriden to `var`, however 
Kotlin doesn't allow this. From what I've read it looks like you used to be able to make 
make method parameters `var` in earlier version of Kotlin but this functionality was removed. 
Bummer!

#### Classes are sealed/final

In Kotlin, all classes are sealed (`final` in Java-speak). This enforces a recommendation 
made in __Effective Java__ (that all classes should be final unless intended for modification). 
I don't think this should be enforced at the language level. I can getting frustrated trying 
to extend Kotlin code written by others and being prevented from doing so because the class 
wasn't opened. I know so far, I ALWAYS forget to open a class until I go to subclass it.

#### Syntax

Not bad, just different. There a few things in Kotlins syntax that I'm just not used to yet, In Kotlin, you 
declare variables Pascal-style, specifying the variable identifier followed by the 
type (`val x: Int`), this constantly trips me up as I am so used to Java where it's 
type then identifier (`int x`). Functions trip me up in a similar manner, with the 
return type at the end of the declaration (`fun add(n1: Int, n2: Int): Int`) instead 
of at the beginning as it is in Java (int add(int n1, int n2)`, I'm sure both of 
these things will quickly become second nature as I spend more time developing in 
the language.
